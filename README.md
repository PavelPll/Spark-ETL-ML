# OBJECTIVE: To get familiar with Spark.
I installed Spark cluster on the AWS cloud and demonstrated some its important functionalities.  Some commands, results and references are listed in the corresponding text files, mentioned in their natural order.

* The file spark_installation.txt describes the installation procedure. This is done on top of a Hadoop YARN cluster, installed previously (for details see Hadoop-Hive project in the current git repository: https://github.com/PavelPll/Hadoop).  
* ./Scala_ETL
* DB_installation.txt  
* hive_some_commands.txt
