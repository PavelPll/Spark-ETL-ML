# OBJECTIVE: Run machine learning on Spark cluster.
Java code file, ML.java, contains the following steps:
* Preprocessing of the initial dataset.
* Data scaling.
* Simple model fiting together with prediction.
* ML pipeline (Scaling + Simple Model) fiting together with prediction. 
* Cross-Validation example. 
> [!NOTE]
> For technical side how to run the code please see the folder ./How_to_run_with_SBT or ./How_to_run_with_MAVEN.
